Tim Yardley is a Principal Research Scientist and Associate Director at the Information Trust Institute (ITI). His primary duties focus on executing the strategic vision and direction for fundamental and applied research in emerging technology throughout the ITI portfolio. Mr. Yardley works in various research areas and engages as the industry lead in structuring research partnerships with ITI. His research is focused on trustworthiness and resiliency, particularly with regards to cybersecurity in critical infrastructure such as the electric power grid. Mr. Yardley is the Principal Investigator in a wide variety of projects, totaling over $40M in cutting-edge research. One of Mr. Yardley’s core thrusts is experimentation frameworks and testbeds, focusing on enabling the inception, development, and verification and validation of mission-critical cybersecurity tools in the electric power grid. Overall, Mr. Yardley’s work is focused on advancing the state of cyber security protection and recovery methods such that they provide actionable intelligence and guidance on what to do with the information.

For over a decade, Mr. Yardley has led the creation of a nation-leading capability in cyber-physical testbeds for the electric power grid. This was most recently demonstrated in the DARPA RADICS program where his team was responsible for the conception, design, and execution of an advanced distributed range on a remote island to explore blackstart restoration under cyber fire. Mr. Yardley continues to lead the way in translating the lessons learned from these efforts into more usable, accessible, and featureful platforms to enable both the researchers of today and tomorrow in this space.
